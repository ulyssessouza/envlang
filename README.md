# Envlang

## Description

Envlang is a simple language for defining environment variables. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and to be easy to use in a variety of contexts. 
It's meant to be configurable through a simple API that lets you define your own Data Access Objects (DAOs) and use them to access the environment variables you need so they can serve as connectors to anything you need.
